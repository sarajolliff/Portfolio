#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/O3TzZ7d-S3E>
#### Description:
My project is a Personal Portfolio, I created this using HTML, CSS and JavasCript, because my main goal is to continue learning and implementing the Website as I go. 

The project has 3 files, an INDEX.HTML, an STYLE.CSS, and a README. The Index.HTML has the body for my Portfolio and contains a HEADER, an ABOUT ME, SERVICES, MY WORK(PORTFOLIO), and CONTACT ME SECTION. Each of those sections has a list, descriptions, images, columns and other programming sections that I styled, and edited through the CSS file. 

Header Section
The header section is the first thing visitors see when they land on the website. It consists of a background image, a logo, a navigation menu, and a header text.

Styling and Design Choices:

The header has a full-width background image that sets the visual tone for the website. The image is positioned at the bottom and has a responsive design, adjusting to different screen sizes.
The logo is displayed at the top left of the header. You can replace the default logo image with your own.
The navigation menu is aligned to the right of the header. It contains links to different sections of the website and is initially hidden on small screens.
The header text introduces the website and grabs the visitors' attention. It includes a title and a subtitle, with the title's last word highlighted in a different color. You can customize the text and styling to fit your personal branding.
Tools and Choices:

HTML tags such as <div>, <nav>, <ul>, and <li> are used to structure and organize the header content.
CSS is used to position and style the header components, including the background image, logo, navigation menu, and header text.
The FontAwesome icon library is used to display the menu icons and toggle the side menu on small screens. The icons are loaded from an external source using a <script> tag in the HTML code.
JavaScript is used to toggle the side menu when the menu icon is clicked.
About Section
The about section provides information about the game developer, including a profile picture, a description, and tabs for different sections (skills, experience, and education).

Styling and Design Choices:

The about section is divided into two columns using flexbox. The left column contains a profile picture, and the right column includes the about description and tabbed content.
The profile picture is displayed on the left side and is styled with a border radius for a rounded look. You can replace the default image with your own.
The about description provides a brief overview of the game developer's background, skills, and goals. It is formatted as a paragraph and uses a moderate font size and line height for easy readability.
The tabbed content allows visitors to switch between different sections of the about information. The tabs are styled as clickable links, and the content is organized into separate divs for each section (skills, experience, and education).
Tools and Choices:

HTML tags such as <div>, <img>, <h1>, <p>, and <ul> are used to structure and display the about content.
CSS is used to style the layout, typography, and tabs within the about section.
JavaScript is used to handle tab switching when a tab link is clicked.
Services Section
The services section highlights the different services provided by the game developer, including game development, web development, and app development.

Styling and Design Choices:

The services section uses a grid layout to display the services in a visually appealing manner.
Each service is represented by a separate div element, which includes an icon, a heading, a description, and a "Learn More" link.
The services' divs have a consistent background color and padding, creating a cohesive look.
The icons are taken from the FontAwesome icon library and are styled with a specific color to match the overall design.

Each project is represented by a separate div element, which includes an image, a caption, and a link to learn more about the project.
The project images have a consistent aspect ratio and are styled with a border radius for a more visually appealing look.
On hover, a layer with a gradient background and additional project information appears over each image, providing more details and a call-to-action link.

Contact information is displayed with appropriate icons for email and phone, along with text descriptions. The icons are styled with a specific color to match the overall design.
The contact form includes input fields for name, email, and message, along with a submit button. It is designed with a clean and straightforward layout.

CSS is used to style the layout, typography, icons, and form elements.
JavaScript is used to submit the contact form data to a Google Sheet, with success and error messages displayed upon submission.
Overall Styling and Design Choices
The template uses a dark color scheme, primarily black and shades of gray, with accents of blue (#6ac1f0) for links and icons. The choice of colors creates a modern and sleek look that is visually appealing.

The template incorporates a responsive design, ensuring that the website looks good and functions well on different screen sizes, from large desktop screens to small mobile devices. Media queries and flexbox are used to adjust the layout and spacing for optimal viewing on various devices.

The FontAwesome icon library is utilized to enhance the visual appeal and provide recognizable icons for navigation, services, and social media links.

The Google Sheet integration for the contact form allows for easy management of contact submissions. The data from the form can be collected and stored in a Google Sheet for further processing or analysis.

These design choices and tools used in the template provide a solid foundation for creating a professional and visually appealing portfolio website for a game developer. Feel free to customize and modify the template according to your preferences and branding.
